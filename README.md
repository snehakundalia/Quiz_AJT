# Quiz_AJT
This is a simple Java Swing Quiz Application that asks 10 multiple-choice GK questions. The user selects an option, clicks Submit, and gets instant feedback (Correct/Incorrect). After each question, a Next button appears, and at the end the score is shown (example: You scored 8/10). No database is used — everything is stored inside the program.
